-- 0045_settle_reports_what_it_banked
--
-- `settle_passive_cultivation` was reporting the cultivation it CALCULATED,
-- not the cultivation that was stored. Those were the same number for as long
-- as `apply_cultivation_xp` accepted everything handed to it. 0044 made it
-- clamp at the bottleneck, and the two parted company immediately: twelve idle
-- hours against a full bar returned "+1,260 cultivation" and banked 260, or
-- none at all.
--
-- A screen that overstates a reward is worse than one that shows nothing. The
-- payout is now measured - read the total, apply, read it again - so the
-- number on the card is by construction the number in the column, and stays
-- that way whatever else ever decides to clamp it.
--
-- Found by the suite: /profile hides "Since you last looked" when nothing
-- accrued, and a character sitting at its ceiling stopped being shown a line
-- it had been promised.
--
-- Forward-only. Do not edit once applied.
